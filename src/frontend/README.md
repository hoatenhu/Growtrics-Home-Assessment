## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Install Flutter 3.10.0 or later
   ```bash
   # Check if Flutter is installed
   flutter --version
   
   # If not installed, download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   ```

2. **Development Environment**: 
   - VS Code with Flutter extension, or
   - Android Studio with Flutter plugin

3. **Backend Service**: Ensure the backend API is running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate model files** (if needed):
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   # For development
   flutter run
   
   # For release
   flutter run --release
   ```

### Configuration

#### Backend URL Configuration
Update the API base URL in `lib/services/api_service.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://your-backend-url:8000';
```

For local development, use:
- **Android Emulator**: `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
- **iOS Simulator**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Physical Device**: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000`

#### Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

**Android** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

**iOS** (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to take photos of homework problems.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to select homework images.</string>
```

## API Integration

The app communicates with the backend through several endpoints:

### Upload Homework
```dart
POST /upload-homework
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: file (image/PDF)
Response: { problem_id, message, filename }
```

### Solve Problem
```dart
POST /homework/solve/{problem_id}
Response: Solution object with questions and explanations
```

### Get Problem Details
```dart
GET /homework/{problem_id}
Response: HomeworkProblem object
```

### List Problems
```dart
GET /homework?limit=10&offset=0
Response: Array of HomeworkProblem objects
```

## Development

### Building for Production

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# iOS (requires Xcode and Apple Developer account)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web
```

### Code Generation

When modifying data models, regenerate serialization code:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flutter command not found**
   - Ensure Flutter is installed and added to your PATH
   - Restart your terminal/IDE after installation

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Check that camera/storage permissions are properly configured
   - Test on a real device if emulator permissions fail

3. **Network connection errors**
   - Verify backend is running and accessible
   - Check firewall settings for local development
   - Use correct IP address for physical device testing

4. **Build errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
   - Delete `pubspec.lock` and reinstall dependencies
   - Check Flutter version compatibility

### Performance Tips

- Use `flutter run --profile` for performance testing
- Enable `flutter inspector` for widget debugging
- Monitor memory usage with `flutter attach --observe`
