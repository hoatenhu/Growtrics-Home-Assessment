## Questions & Answers

### 1. What attracted you to our startup?  
I am passionate about education. I once had an idea with friends about an education app but couldn’t execute it. When I saw your startup, I felt it was the right chance to join and build for this market. With AI becoming a powerful force—like how the industrial revolution replaced manual labor—I believe now is the perfect time to create real impact in education.

### 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?  

**Good traits (and why):**  
- **Problem-solving:** I stay calm under pressure, find root causes, and propose pragmatic fixes.  
- **Reliable:** I honor commitments, communicate risks early, and keep stakeholders aligned.  
- **Curious:** I self-learn quickly and bring new tools/ideas to improve team velocity.  

**Bad traits (and context):**  
- **Impatient with bureaucracy:** I prefer lean processes; I’ll often suggest simplifications to keep momentum.  
- **Need time to adapt to new environments:** I observe in the first 1–2 weeks to understand context; after that my pace stabilizes fast.  
- **Sometimes too straightforward when giving feedback:** I value honesty and clarity, but I’m learning to phrase it in a more positive and supportive way so it feels constructive for others.

### 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?  
I would place it in space, on a satellite with NASA, so the world can see:  

*“Ever tried, ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better. The world is yours—treat everyone kindly and light up the night.”* — Samuel Beckett

### 7. What do you believe is true, but can’t prove?  
I believe small acts of kindness ripple far beyond what we see, shaping lives in unseen ways. A brief thank-you, a helpful pointer, or sharing an opportunity can nudge someone’s path—and they may later help others in a chain reaction. We can’t fully measure this (no full feedback loops or clean causality), but experience suggests the cumulative effect is real.
